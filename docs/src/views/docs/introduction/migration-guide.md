# Migration Guide

Developers who are looking to migrate off the Shopify CLI and to Syncify CLI can follow this guide. It's important that developers first make the determination on whether Syncify is the right choice for them or their team. Though there are many benefits to Syncify, it is important that developers are aware that Syncify is an independent solution.

# Tooling

Syncify is designed to be used together with additional tooling to enhance its usage. Developers who are using the VSCode Shopify (Theme Check) Extension are encouraged to uninstall and instead use the VSCode Liquid Extension which has integrated support for Syncify development.
