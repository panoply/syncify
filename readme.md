# Shopify Sync

A lightning-fast node equivalent shopify [theme kit](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/) tool. Supports watching, uploading and downloading of Shopify theme files to multiple storefronts concurrently. A concise and clear log interface, custom file transit control and much more!

### Why?

Because Shopify tooling is utter garbage. The likelihood of a project maintained by the Shopify team lasting longer than 12 months is slim and typically they are just mediocre. This module does one job, it's flexible, does not require you to install 20+ fucking ruby gems and will not lock you into some poorly thought through workflow or theme development apparatus.

### Use case?

The main purpose of the module is to watch a specified directory in your project and upload/remove changed or modified files to a configured Shopify theme target. Additionally, the tool supports download/upload features.

## Installation

PNPM

```cli
pnpm i shopify-sync --dev
```

Yarn

```cli
yarn add shopify-sync --dev
```

NPM

```cli
npm install shopify-sync --save-dev
```

After installing, you will need to create a `.shopifysync.json` file and place it in the root of your directory. This file will hold your store API credentials. The configuration file should be written in `JSON` and store themes to sync should be defined via the `targets[]` property, eg:

```jsonc
{
  "dir": "example", // The directory to watch
  "targets": [
    {
      "target_name": "development", // The name of the theme target
      "api_key": "", // Shopify API Key
      "password": "", // Shopify Password
      "domain": "your-store", // Your myshopify name (without .myshopify)
      "primary_domain": "https://primary-domain.com", // Primary domain, eg: www.store.com
      "theme_name": "Development", // The theme name
      "theme_id": 123456789 // The theme ID
    }
  ]
}
```

##### JSON Schema

If you're using an editor like vscode or one that supports JSON IntelliSense features you can grab the Schema Store configuration file can be provided by referencing the [json-schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panoply/shopify-sync/master/json-schema.json) file in this repository via the `$schema` property, eg:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panoply/shopify-sync/master/json-schema.json"
}
```

## Script Usage

You can run Shopify Sync via the [CLI](#cli) or initialize as a function in a node script, eg:

```javascript
import sync from 'shopify-sync'

sync('watch',  // Resource type (upload, download, watch)
{
  dir: 'example', // The directory of to watch
  target: 'development', // Your theme target
  concurrency: 20, // Number of parallel requests
  forceIgnore: false,  // Apply ignores at chokidor instance
  ignore: [ // Accepts an array of files and/or an anymatch `/*/**` wildcard
    'example/ignore-dir/**/**'
    'example/assets/*.map.js',
    'example/snippets/ignore.liquid'
  ]
}, function(){

   // Execute callback function
   // this.file will returns parsed file path object)
   // this.content will return the buffer content
   console.log(this)

})

```

Create a script command within your `package.json` file.

```json
"scripts": {
   "sync": "node src/name-of-file.js"
}
```

If you're using a tool like Gulp 4 you can call upon the sync from within a task function, eg:

```javascript
import sync from 'shopify-sync'

function syncTask (done) {

   sync('watch', {
      dir: 'example',
      target: 'development',
      ignore: [
         'example/sections/ignore.js',
         'example/assets/ignore.liquid'
      ]
   })

   done()
}

export.default = parallel(exampleTask, syncTask)

```

### CLI

Execute the sync via the command line. You can install the project globaly or locally. If you're installing locally create a reference in your `package.json` file, for example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "sync": "sync"
  }
}
```

> If yo've instaled globally you can access the CLI using the `sync` command

##### Commands

| Command                  | Details                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `sync`                   | Show list of commands                         |
| `sync watch`             | Starts watching a directory                   |
| `sync upload`            | Uploads files, (accepts a filter).            |
| `sync download`          | Downloads the theme                           |
| `--target=[target_name]` | Explicitly select theme target                |
| `--filter=[filename]`    | Only transfer files matching specified filter |

## Options

When initializing via a node script you have a couple of additional options opposed to running sync from the CLI. In most cases running the command `watch` will suffice but for those who may want to manipulate files in transit or for additional control the API ships with the following:

| Option        | Type     | Default    |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| `resource`    | string   | _Required_ |
| `target`      | string   | _Required_ |
| `dir`         | string   | 'theme'    |
| `concurrency` | Number   | `20`       |
| `forceIgnore` | Boolean  | `true`     |
| `ignore`      | Array    | `[]`       |
| `callback`    | Function | `()`       |

**`resource`** <br>
The `resource` option is a **required** option and is the first argument that is passed in. There are 3 available resources to call, they are: `watch`, `upload` or `download`.

**`dir`**<br>
The `dir` option defaults to `theme` and is the directory that the sync will watch, upload or download modified or changed files from. The watch resource will only accept a directory that resides within the root of your project.

**`target`**<br>
The `target` option is **required** and is the reference point to your Shopify stores API credentials. The target defined here should reflect the `target_name` property defined in your config file.

**`concurrency`**<br>
The `concurrency` option defaults to 20. This option will allow you to set a number of parallel requests to run when uploading or downloading theme files. Please note that all asset syncs are executed asynchronously.

**`forceIgnore`**<br>
Forcefully ignores files from the chokidar instance which will prevent them from being read and printing to stdout. This option is recommended if you are ignoring a large quantity of files and want to keep your logs clean.

**`ignore`**<br>
The ignore option accepts an array of files. You must use full path (`theme/assets/*.map`) glob patterns.

**`callback`**<br>
A callback function executed post transfer. Access the passed in file path and its content via the functions _this_ scope. `this.file` will return the parsed file path and `this.content` will supply you with a Buffer of the files contents, eg:

```javascript
{
   file: {
      root: String,
      dir: String,
      base: String,
      ext: String,
      name: String
   },
   content: <Buffer>
}
```

> Use `this.content.toString()` to return the file content as a string opposed to Buffer.

# Contributing

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en/cli/install) (because pnpm is dope and pnpm does dope shit) - Fork the project, run `pnpm i` and you're good to go. If you're using Yarn like the rest of the plebs or npm like the boomers then you will still need to install pnpm.
