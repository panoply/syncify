# Syncify Demos

This directory contains various sub-modules demos which intend to provide developers starting points for developing with Syncify. You will find several different sample projects, each which will progressively showcase more advanced example usage of Syncify.

### Dawn Basic

The most elementary example of Syncify. This demo uses Shopify Dawn and does some very basic bundling. If you are just hearing about Syncify and are familiar with Dawn but still learning about theme development on Shopify, then this is a great starting point for you.

### Dawn Advanced

This is a higher level example of Syncify and [Dawn](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn). Different capabilities are implemented in this demo and it showcases more advanced configurations. If you have have some experience with Syncify, have used Dawn before and looking to improve your workflow by leveraging Syncify to handle bundling of SASS, TypeScript and more while still respecting Dawn pre-existing files, then take a peak at this one.

# Dusk (Coming Soon)

This is blank strap example which you can also generate from the command line via `syncify --strap dusk` - Dusk is a bare bones sample with all the atrocities stripped out of Dawn. It offers a bare bones starter with pre-baked essentials. While the example is still Dawn, it is simply a modular variation of it without the chaotic mess. Great for developers who are familiar with Syncify, know what they are doing and simply require a stripped out version of Dawn.

# Silk (Coming Soon)

This is a 10x strap which you can also also generate from the command line via `syncify --strap silk` - Silk is not Dawn, it is a completely different theme that leverages several modules I have developed and maintain specifically designed for advanced use cases and performance. Silk is a strap that implements [SPX](https://github.com/spx) and also provides developer workspace essentials that I created such as [vscode-liquid](https://github.com/vscode-liquid).
