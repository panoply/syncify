# Silk

An oppionated Shopify theme boilerplate leveraging [Syncify](#).

### License

You do not have permission to use Silk for developing themes with an intent to sell them in the Shopify theme store. Developers can freely use the approaches empolyed by Silk for merchants and independent businesses.

### Why?

In 2021 Shopify overhauled their development ecosystem which resulted in the [Dawn](#) theme and [Hydrogen](#). I was not impressed by either, especially Hydrogen with its all ecompassing React baked-in approach which merely enables Facebook to continue to hold a monoply over open source. Super uncool stuff.


### Included

- ESLint, Prettier, Liquify, Stylelint presets.
- TypeScript/JavaScript compiled using [esbuild](#) and [rollup.js](#)
- SASS/SCSS tranformating using PostCSS for post-processing.
- SVG Icon Sprites transformed with the powerful SVGO
- Instantaneous SSR rendering using [shabu.js](#) + [stimulus.js](#)
- Leverages [mithril.js](#) for virtual DOM powered components
- Refined [Dawn](#) theme variant used as the demo.
- Powered with the [pnpm](#) package manager.
