Brixtol Textiles is doing what we can to reduce returns. Our reason for this is the unnecessary environmental impact caused in the transportation of orders. Another aspect is the high costs for shipping and handling. We encourage our customers to think again before ordering 2 sizes of the same style to compare which is a better fit.
